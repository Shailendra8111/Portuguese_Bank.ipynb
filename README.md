## OBJECTIVE 

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portugese Bank institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribve to a term deposit (y).
## Domain Analysis

#### 1. Introduction

The dataset provided is of a Portuguese bank. They are a banking institution.
We aim to find whether a marketing campaign has helped them increase the number of people who have subscribed to a term deposit.

##### 2. Contextual factors 

Factors in our dataset like the Consumer price index tell us the relative price a customer has paid for the same product. Other factors like the consumer confidence index which tells us how consumers are feeling about the current market situation and the future of the market, and Euribor which is a reference rate that is constructed from the average interest rate at which eurozone banks offer unsecured short-term lending on the inter-bank market, and net rate employed which is The variable, nr  employed, refers to the number of employees in a bank and is also an influential variable on clients' intention to subscribe to the term deposit.

#### 3. Data and Information

The data we have in our dataset is a mixture of categorical Data and Numerical data.

### On the basis of the analyses reports we can observe that :
     1. People aged between 30-40 years were contacted the most
     2. People from "admin" job role and people from "blue-collared" job roles were contacted the most 
     3. Married people were contacted the most followed by single people
     4. people with 'university' education followed by 'high school' education were contacted the most 
     5. we can see that most of the people that were contacted did not have a default status

## Report on Challenges Faced

1. Transforming unstructured data into tabular format, followed by exporting it into a CSV file.
2. Analyzing the data and identifying its requirements.
3. During the conversion of Object data type to Numerical data type, manual encoding was necessary for all        columns.
4. Integrating all Machine Learning models into a unified code for improved accessibility and clarity.
